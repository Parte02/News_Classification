# News Classification System

This repository contains code for a news classification system that categorizes news articles into different topics using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The news classification system uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to classify news articles into predefined categories. The system is capable of handling both text-based news articles and URLs pointing to online news articles.

## Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: The system supports classification into multiple categories, allowing for a comprehensive categorization of news articles.
- **Customizable**: Users can customize the categories according to their specific needs and preferences.
- **Easy Integration**: The system can be easily integrated into existing applications or used as a standalone service.
- **High Accuracy**: The classification models have been trained on large datasets and achieve high accuracy in categorizing news articles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parte02/News_Classification.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download any necessary datasets or pre-trained models (add instructions if applicable).

## Usage

- To classify a single news article, run:

```bash
python classify_news.py --article <path_to_article>
```

- To classify multiple news articles, run:

```bash
python classify_news.py --batch <path_to_batch_file>
```

## Customization

Users can customize the categories by modifying the configuration file [config.yaml](config.yaml).

## Contributing
